## Project Overview

This project is a robust web application developed using Node.js and Express.js. It leverages MongoDB as its primary database for data storage and Redis for efficient caching to enhance performance. The architecture of the project is service-oriented, with each service encapsulating a specific functionality, complete with its own set of endpoints and configurations.

### Services

The services are meticulously configured in the `app/config.yml` file. At present, the application comprises two main services: `firstService` and `secondService`. Each service is autonomous and has its own dedicated port, base URL, endpoints, and secret key for secure communication.

### Database

The database connection is proficiently managed by the `app/utils/database.js` file. It employs Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, to establish a connection with the MongoDB database. The database URL and name are conveniently configured in the `app/utils/config.js` file, allowing for easy modifications if required.

### Caching

Caching is adeptly handled by the `app/utils/cache.js` file. It utilizes Redis, a high-performance in-memory data structure store, and Bluebird, a fully-featured Promise library, to create a Redis client. This setup significantly improves the application's response time by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

### Server

The server is configured in the `app/server.js` file. It uses Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. The server setup includes middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), logging with Morgan, parsing JSON with Body-Parser, and a custom middleware for additional functionality.

### Configuration

The project's configuration is securely stored in the `app/utils/config.js` file. It includes vital parameters such as the MongoDB URL, database name, secret key for secure transactions, salt round for password hashing to enhance security, and the port on which the server listens for incoming requests.
